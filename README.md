SCRU64 ID offers compact, time-ordered unique identifiers generated by
distributed nodes. SCRU64 has the following features:

- ~62-bit non-negative integer storable as signed/unsigned 64-bit integer
- Sortable by generation time (as integer and as text)
- 12-digit case-insensitive textual representation (Base36)
- ~38-bit Unix epoch-based timestamp that ensures useful life until year 4261
- Variable-length node/machine ID and counter fields that share 24 bits

```go
import "os"
import "fmt"
import "github.com/scru64/go-scru64"

// pass node ID through environment variable
os.Setenv("SCRU64_NODE_SPEC", "42/8")

// generate a new identifier object
x := scru64.New()
fmt.Println(x)        // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt3"
fmt.Println(x.Uint()) // as a 64-bit unsigned integer

// generate a textual representation directly
fmt.Println(scru64.NewString()) // e.g., "0u2r85hm2pt4"
```

See [SCRU64 Specification] for details.

SCRU64's uniqueness is realm-specific, i.e., dependent on the centralized
assignment of node ID to each generator. If you need decentralized, globally
unique time-ordered identifiers, consider [SCRU128].
